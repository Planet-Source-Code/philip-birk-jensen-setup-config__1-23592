## Setup Config

### Description

This is not an install creator, but editor 

----

This will edit the setup program created by "Package & Deployment Wizard", that follows with VB (I think will all versions). 

----

What it does is it edits the setup.lst file, that controls the whole setup process. There is a few functions that you can't do in the standard setup creator. 

----

There are still some functions that don't work, but I will keep on updating. It's mainly just functions I haven't typed in yet, nothing hard to do, I just need to type then in.
